        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language, most commonly HTML. It is a fundamental technology of the World Wide Web, working alongside HTML (which provides structure and content) and JavaScript (which adds interactivity). </p>
        <h3 class="highlight">Key Features of CSS</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Separation of Content and Presentation: CSS allows developers to separate the content of a webpage (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), making it easier to maintain and update the design.</li>
            <li>Selectors and Properties: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply specific styles using properties. For example, you can change the color, font, size, and layout of elements.</li>
            <li>Box Model: CSS employs the box model concept, which defines how elements are rendered on the page, including margins, borders, padding, and content area.</li>
            <li>Responsive Design: CSS enables responsive web design through media queries, allowing websites to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</li>
            <li>Flexbox and Grid Layouts: CSS provides powerful layout modules like Flexbox and Grid, making it easier to create complex and flexible layouts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="highlight">Benefits of Using CSS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved Website Performance: CSS reduces the amount of HTML code, leading to faster page load times and improved performance.</li>
            <li>Consistency Across Pages: CSS allows for a consistent look and feel across multiple pages of a website, making it easier to maintain a cohesive design.</li>
            <li>Easy Maintenance: With CSS, you can make global style changes by editing a single stylesheet, rather than updating individual HTML elements.</li>
            <li>Enhanced User Experience: CSS enables the creation of visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, improving the overall user experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, CSS is a powerful tool for web developers and designers, enabling them to create visually stunning and responsive websites that provide an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.</p>
